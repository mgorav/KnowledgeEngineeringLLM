## Demystifying Per-Model LLM Training: A Technical Deep Dive

While fine-tuning adapts pretrained models like BERT through retraining, crafting new LLMs from scratch offers ultimate customization. Let's explore the technical intricacies of per-model training.

**Architecture Design**

Choosing LLM topology involves balancing model capacity and trainability:

- Encoder-decoder transformers demonstrate strong generalization
- Sparsely activated models enhance efficiency
- Hybrid approaches combine strengths like memory augmented networks

**Data Preparation**

Training data diversity directly impacts capability breadth:

- Text corpora form core, encoded via SentencePiece tokenization
- Images, audio, video framed as text for seamless ingestion
- Tabular data and knowledge graphs encoded as serialized text

**Computational Scale**

Hardware constraints necessitate efficient model parallelism:

- Model parallel - split layers across GPUs
- Pipeline parallel - split samples across GPUs
- Expert parallel - partition categories of tokens

This allows scaling to trillions of parameters.

**Objective Function**

Unlike fixed metrics like accuracy, LLM goals involve subjective human preferences like interestingness, harmlessness, and truthfulness. Reinforcement learning from human feedback shows promise.

**Training Methodology**

LLM training alternates between imitation learning from data and human interaction for preference learning:

1. Pretrain on large corpora through predictive language modeling
2. Human preference based fine-tuning
3. Repeat

Blending scalable autonomous learning with subjective human guidance crafts desirable behaviors, unlocking previously unattainable prowess.

> NOTE
> AMP stands for Automatic Mixed Precision. It is an optimization technique for neural network training that can accelerate training performance and reduce memory usage.
> The key idea behind AMP is that it performs calculations using both single precision floating point format (FP32) and half precision format (FP16) during training. Some of the key aspects of AMP are:
>  It automatically converts tensors to FP16 format where possible to save memory bandwidth and space. But it retains FP32 for calculations where precision is critical.
The loss scaling technique is used to counter the rounding errors that occur in FP16 so that the overall training can converge correctly.
PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks have AMP built-in to enable easy activation and automatic handling of conversions behind the scenes.
Some benefits of using AMP:
> Reduces memory bandwidth usage by up to 50%, allowing larger batch sizes and model sizes to be trained on current hardware
Increases arithmetic intensity for faster computation
Accelerates training performance, with speedups reported up to 60% quicker convergence
In summary, AMP provides an optimized and accelerated execution of math while retaining accuracy and precision where necessary - making it very useful for large language model training which involves immense computational demands.
