## Conversational Knowledge Agents
Conversational agents powered by LLMs like ChatGPT promise more intuitive human-machine interaction by using natural dialogue [8]. KE applications can enhance such agents with domain knowledge to provide reliable domain-specific advice.

Some notable opportunities in this architecture include:
1. Encoding expertise as conversational rules and prompts
2. Dialog managers that switch conversation flows based on ontologies
3. Verifying LLM responses using knowledge base facts
4. Maintaining updated knowledge through human-in-the-loop annotation

Research problems span design principles for predictable dialog, scaling knowledge linking, transparent explanations, and consistency evaluation through longitudinal human studies.

The conversational interface lowers adoption barriers for experts. But compared to formal knowledge authoring, risks like factual errors and specification gaps need rigorous analysis. Formal modeling still plays an important role to enable complex reasoning and system validation.
