## Open Challenges
Realizing the potential of LLMs for industrial-grade KE involves tackling foundational research across capabilities, evaluation, and integration:

1. Reasoning: How to achieve explainable, consistent, and verifiable LLM-based inference? Can prompt programming alone solve complex chains for mission-critical applications?

2. Knowledge Fusion: What are robust architectures for knowledge exchange between LLMs and ontologies/rules? How to synchronize facts across neural and symbolic stores?

3. Data Management: How to enable collaborative knowledge authoring? Can LLMs assist managing large knowledge repositories?

4. Evaluation: How to thoroughly benchmark capabilities and reliability? How to combine test suites with human assessment? How to measure transparency?

5. Security: How to address risks like data exposure and model manipulation attacks?

The challenges span theory, systems, and application. Breakthroughs necessitate cross-pollination across machine learning, knowledge representation, reasoning, NLP, and application domains like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.
