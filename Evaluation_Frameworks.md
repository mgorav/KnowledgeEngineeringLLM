## Evaluation Frameworks
Evaluating knowledge captured by LLMs poses challenges different from traditional accuracy metrics [5]. Key aspects include:
1. Correctness: Testing for hallucinated or misleading facts
2. Consistency: Whether knowledge conforms to domain constraints
3. Interpretability: Transparency of LLM behaviors and decisions

One methodology is to verify facts predicted by LLMs against ground truth knowledge graphs and ontologies [6]. This can identify incorrect outputs but has limitations in coverage.

Alternatively, human evaluation through tests designed by subject experts provides a robust methodology. Metrics can assess dimensions like appropriate reasoning, consistency, and trust. However, this approach can be time-consuming and harder to scale.

Hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine automated verification, simulation testing, and targeted human evaluation provide a pragmatic methodology. The objective is to balance coverage, cost, and accuracy.
