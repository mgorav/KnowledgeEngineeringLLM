## Augmenting Expertise with Language: Incorporating LLMs into Knowledge Systems

While knowledge engineering (KE) produces valuable computable expertise, the process remains tedious for experts and brittle to change. Large language models (LLMs) now offer a pathway to transform legacy approaches. By encoding knowledge naturally through language itself, LLMs can ease authoring, adapt understanding, explain reasoning, and enable reliable hybrid platforms.

**Intuitive Knowledge Authoring**

LLMs facilitate conversing directly with experts in natural dialogue to elicit policies, rules, and insights. This provides a more intuitive experience than formal modeling or questionnaires. Dynamic interactions also allow capturing rich observations and backstories that static approaches often miss.

**Flexible Knowledge Representation**

Rather than tightly-coupled ontologies, LLMs enable loosely-coupled knowledge as an interconnected fabric of narratives, statements, and conversational contexts. Built on language itself, this form fits more naturally with how humans conceptualize domains. The woven fabric also evolves more organically through new dialogues rather than purely manual rework.

**Transparent Decision Making**

While skilled in language understanding, unaugmented LLM reasoning lacks rigor. Combining LLM-extracted signals with structured symbolic logic introduces formal verifiability:

```
LLM provides relevant passages → Symbolic rules deduce decisions → LLM generates explanations
```

Keeping humans explicitly in the loop makes the combined system more robust and trustworthy.

**Mathematical Foundations**

We can model LLM knowledge as probability distributions over sequences:

```
P(t1, ...., tn) = Π P(ti | t1, ...., ti-1)
```

Here ti are tokens like words. Transformer networks encode long-range dependencies in the sequence. Additional techniques like mutual information maximization can potentially reduce contradictions in captured knowledge.

To enable reliable decision making, the probability distributions need fusion with formal constraints and verifiable deductive systems. Architecting these neuro-symbolic systems remains an open research challenge.

**The Road Ahead**

While barriers exist in accuracy, bias, and transparency, LLM injection into knowledge platforms promises to transform expertise elicitation, representation, and application. Blending language understanding with logical verification can pave the path ahead for truly intelligent systems - collaboratively enhancing human capability rather than replacing it.
